## Task 1: Phased Methylation Pattern (PMP) Analysis

### **Objective**
Analyze phased methylation patterns to identify biomarkers with high specificity for tissue differentiation.

### **Sub-Tasks**
1. **Coverage Analysis:**
   - Calculate the median and coefficient of variation (CV) for single CpG coverage in each tissue.
   - Generate plots summarizing the coverage statistics.

2. **Biomarker Identification:**
   - Identify PMPs with high specificity for tissue differentiation, minimizing false positives for cfDNA while allowing some false negatives.
   - Calculate the mean variant read fraction (VRF) for each PMP in both tissues.

3. **Additional Questions:**
   - How does sequencing depth affect specificity confidence?
   - Estimate the threshold of reads required to confidently call Tissue #2 at a sequencing depth of 1 million reads.
   - Validate the hypothesis by comparing the specificity of the top 10 PMPs against individual CpG sites.

### **How to Run**
