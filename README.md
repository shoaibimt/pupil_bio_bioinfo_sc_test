# Phased Methylation Pattern (PMP) and NGS Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for the bioinformatics challenge, focusing on:
1. **Task 1- Phased Methylation Pattern (PMP) Analysis**: Identifying methylation patterns with high tissue specificity using statistical/ machine learning approaches.
2. **Task2- NGS Data Analysis**: Processing raw sequencing data to perform quality control and identify somatic mutations.

The repository includes scripts, analysis results, and a detailed report summarizing findings, supported by visualizations.
